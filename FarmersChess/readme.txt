Farmer's chess
--------------

Gala, also knows as "Farmer's chess" or "Pagan chess" was a game played in some 
farmers villages in northern Germany. The game probably comes from the middle ages. 
It has been mentioned in the game books by R. C. Bell, Jack Botermans / Pieter van Delft 
and Glonnegger.

Game goals:

- to capture both of the enemy Galas
- or to move both Galas to the four central squares.

Kampas move diagonally towards the middle of the board until they are in the 
middle part or in the opponents corners. It is allowed to move two squares 
if the deflection line isn't passed with the first move of the Kampa. 
When the Kampa is in the middle part or in one of the opponents corners, 
then it may move one square in any direction. When a Kampa is moved back 
to a corner of the owning player, it can only move diagonally forward again. 
Kampas only can take in the move after they have crossed a deflection line.
Kampa can't move to "nobile" squares.

Horsas are just the opposite of Kornas (with an additional small difference 
in the taking rules): they move as bishops on the corner parts, and as rooks 
on the middle part. Again it is possible to combine such moves. If the Horsa 
has moved one or more squares before crossing the line, it may then only move 
one square. Horsas only take in moves where they pass the deflection line,
but not when they move only one square in rookwise fashion.

A Korna moves as a rook in chess when in a corner of the board, and as 
a bishop in the middle of the board. It is also possible to combine these moves 
in one turn. If the Korna has moved one or more squares before crossing 
the deflection line, it may then only move one square. Kornas can only take 
in moves where they move over a deflection line.

Galas move in general as kings in chess. Additionally, when a Gala is on one
of the four squares in the middle of the board, it may be moved in one move
to any empty square on the board with the exception of those squares that 
contain a piece in the opening setup. Kings can only take when moving over 
a deflection line.
