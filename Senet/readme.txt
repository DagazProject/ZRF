Axiomatic Senet
---------------

3 variants:
  - Kendall's (1978)
  - Dmitry Skiryuk (2011)
  - Valentin Chelnokov (2015)

Senet is one of the oldest known board games. It has been found in predynastic 
and First Dynasty burials of Egypt, c. 3500 BC and 3100 BC respectively.

The winner is the first to move all of their pawns off the board.

When a pawn reached a square already occupied by an opponent pawn, they have to 
exchange their positions.

The special squares have the following effects on play:

  - 15: House of Rebirth, starting square and the return square for the pawns 
        reaching square number 27
  - 26: House of Happiness, a mandatory square for all the pawns.
  - 27: House of Water, a square that can be reached by the pawns located 
        on squares 28 to 30 which moved back when their throws did not allow 
        them to exit the board. They have to restart from square 15.
  - 28: House of the Three Truths, a pawn may only leave when a 3 is thrown.
  - 29: House of the Re-Atoum, a pawn may only leave when a 2 is thrown.
