Thud!
-----

Thud is a board game devised by Trevor Truran and first published in 2002, 
inspired by the Terry Pratchett's Discworld novels.

In the game, the objective is to eliminate as many of the opposition's pieces 
as possible. The two antagonists are the trolls and the dwarfs, the trolls 
being few in number (but individually very powerful), while there are a large 
number of dwarfs, but each individual dwarf is very weak and requires support 
from nearby dwarfs to be of use against the trolls.

On the dwarfs' turn, they may either move or hurl one dwarf:

     Move: any one dwarf is moved like a chess queen, any number of squares in 
           any orthogonal or diagonal direction, but not onto or through any 
           other piece, whether Thudstone, dwarf, or troll; or
     Hurl: anywhere there is a straight (orthogonal or diagonal) line of 
           adjacent dwarfs on the board, they may hurl the front dwarf in 
           the direction continuing the line, as long as the space between the 
           lead dwarf and the troll is less than the number of dwarfs in 
           the line. This is different from a normal move in that the dwarf 
           is permitted to land on a square containing a troll, in which case 
           the troll is removed from the board and the dwarf takes his place. 
           This may only be done if the endmost dwarf can land on a troll 
           by moving in the direction of the line at most as many spaces 
           as there are dwarfs in the line. Since a single dwarf is a line of 
           one in any direction, a dwarf may always move one space to capture 
           a troll on an immediately adjacent square.

On the trolls' turn, they may either move or shove one troll:

     Move: one troll is moved like a chess king, one square in any orthogonal 
           or diagonal direction onto an empty square. After the troll has been 
           moved, any dwarfs on the eight squares adjacent to the moved troll 
           may optionally [2] be immediately captured and removed from the 
           board, at the troll player's discretion; or
    Shove: anywhere there is a straight (orthogonal or diagonal) line of 
           adjacent trolls on the board, they may shove the endmost troll 
           in the direction continuing the line, up to as many spaces as there 
           are trolls in the line. As in a normal move, the troll may not land 
           on an occupied square, and any dwarfs in the eight squares adjacent 
           to its final position may immediately be captured. Trolls may only 
           make a shove if by doing so they capture at least one dwarf.

Koom Valley Thud
----------------

For the 2005 rerelease of Thud, Truran devised a substantially different game 
that could be played with the same board and pieces, known as Koom Valley Thud.

For the dwarfs to win they must move the rock to the far side of the valley - 
onto any of the five squares on the opposite side of the board against which 
the dwarf commander is sitting. For the trolls to win they must capture the 
rock by placing three trolls adjacent to it (in any direction including 
diagonally). If neither side can achieve their objective the game is drawn.

Movement is the same as Classic Thud except that Trolls may now move up to 
3 spaces in any direction (horizontal, vertical or diagonal).

Dwarfs may move the Rock instead of moving a dwarf piece. It may move only one 
square in any direction. To be moved it must be next to a dwarf and it must 
also be next to a dwarf at the end of its move.

A troll captures a dwarf by trampling over it. It moves in a straight line 
from a square next to the dwarf, through the square the dwarf is on and lands 
on the empty square immediately beyond. The trampled dwarf is removed from 
the board.

Several captures may be made in one move and a change of direction is allowed 
between captures.

Dwarfs capture a troll by moving a dwarf so that the troll is trapped between
two dwarfs in any straight line (including diagonally). The three pieces, 
two dwarfs and a troll, must all be in line.

If the dwarf that has been moved also traps another troll between itself and 
another dwarf, that troll is also captured

Captures are only made when the capturing side moves a piece. The rock may be 
moved and come to rest next to three trolls. It can only be captured when 
a troll is moved.

Koom Valley Football
--------------------

It's my variant of the Koom Valley Thud. Added a few changes in the rules 
of the game:

1) Not allowed to capture of the opponent's pieces
2) Ball (unlike Rock) can move more than one square
3) Trolls can't move to the edge of the board
