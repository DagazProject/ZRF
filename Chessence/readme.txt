Chessence
---------
2 variants

This game was invented by Jim Winslow in 1989.

Each player has a king and nine men with initial setup as shown, including 
three men initially not yet in play at the side of the board. For a turn, 
a player may move a man on the board, or alternatively, he may put one of his 
reserve men in play by placing it on any of his six initial starting squares 
that is currently open.

Kings do not move and must remain fixed on their starting squares the entire 
game. A man has capability to move based on its relative position to other 
friendly men on the board, as follows:

- If a man is orthogonally adjacent to a friendly man, then both have the 
  ability to move as a rook in chess.

- If a man is diagonally adjacent to a friendly man, then both have the 
  ability to move as a chess bishop.

- If a man is a knight's move away from a friendly man, then both have the 
  ability to move as a knight.

To win, a player must checkmate or stalemate the opponent.
