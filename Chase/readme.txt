Chase
-----

This game was designed by Tom Kruszewski, published in 1986 by TSR.

Each turn you may make one move. The basic move is to move one of your dice: 
a die must move exactly the number of spaces as the number showing on top of 
the die. No more, no less. It cannot pass through another piece or the Chamber. 
If it lands on another piece, that piece is captured (if an opponent's piece) 
or bumped one space (if your own piece). A bumped piece can further bump or 
capture a piece.

Pieces that move off the sides of the board continue their movement from 
the opposite edge: the board is a wrap-around board, left-right. 
Pieces that hit one of the two starting edges ricochet back towards 
the center of the board.

There are two special moves in addition to those above: the Exchange 
and the Chamber move. An exchange involves no actual movement, 
but still takes your whole turn. You simply turn one die so a lower number 
is showing on its face, and turn an adjacent die (of your own color only). 
For example, a 5 and 2 may become a 3 and 4.

Pieces moving into the Chamber by exact are split two pieces that exit
the Chamber onto the two hexagons adjacement to the origonal piece's
point of entry. A piece may never be bumped into the Chamber.

The sum of all your dice must always equal 25. So if one of your dice 
is captured, you must adjust one or more dice higher to bring your total back 
to 25. The count of the die on the board with the lowest speed is increased
by the speed of the captured piece. If player is reduced to four or fewer dice,
he can never have a speed count of 25, and so loses the game.
