Non Stop Kamisado
-----------------
5 variants

This game was invented by Peter Burley in 2008.

The players take turns to move a dragon tower, each attempting
to be the first to place a dragon tower on a square within
their opponent's home row.

For the first move only, the player making this move can select
any of eight dragon towers as the one to be moved.

For all subsequent moves, each player must move the dragon tower
that matches the colour of the square on which their opponent's
previous move finished.
