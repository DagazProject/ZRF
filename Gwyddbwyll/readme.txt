Pieces can moving vertically or horizontally on some squares:
  * Squire or King to 1 step
  * Knight to 1-2 steps
  * Champion to 1-3 steps
Vertically and horizontally movements may be interleaved

  * 3 - Squire can move
  * 4 - Knight or Squire can move
  * 5 - Black King, Champion, Knight or Squire can move
  * 6 - Any piece can move
If no pieces can move then player pass turn

Capturing:

Each piece has its own power:
  * Squire - 1 point
  * Knight - 2 points
  * Black King or Champion - 3 points
  * White King (Pendragon) - 4 points
The piece may be captured if it's surrounded by enemy pieces total power which exceeds its own
Capturing performs as in Chess by any piece which can move
