Ohojichi is played in the Agbo region of the Ivory Coast. It is a very unusual 
mancala game, which seems to be related to Lontu-holu of the Bush Negroes 
in Suriname. The game has been spelled Ohojitxi, when it was first described by 
Jordi Climent Tondo in 2009, but this is a Catalanisation of the Ivorian 
spelling.

On his turn a player picks up the seeds of one of his holes and then 
distributes them, one by one, counterclockwise into the ensuing holes of 
his half of the board. 

A move ends after one sowing. 

The contents of a hole are captured, when the last seed makes a four. 
Any fours in a continuous line preceding this hole (on the player's own half 
of the board) are also captured.

The captured seeds are picked up and then placed into one hole of his opponent.

A player wins, if he has passed all his seeds to his opponent (i.e. when 
his side has become empty).
