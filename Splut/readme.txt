Splut! is a 2-4 players abstract board game that was invented by 
Tommy De Coninck in 2009.  

The object of the game is to kill all opposing Sorcerers by throwing 
a Rock on their heads. Once a Sorcerer dies, his entire team is removed 
from the board.

One of the players begins and players move in turn. Each turn a player 
must make 3 steps. However, the first player on his first turn must make 
only 1 step and the second player on his first turn must make only 2 steps.

Each step includes choosing one of the player's pieces and moving it to 
an horizontally or vertically adjacent square. A step may result in moving 
some other pieces (including Rocks) depending on the type of the chosen piece.

A Stonetroll can perform two kinds of special steps that result in moving Rocks: 
pulling a Rock and throwing a Rock.

A Stonetroll may pull a Rock that was located on the square right behind 
the Stonetroll, i.e. on the horizontally or vertically adjacent square on 
the same line as the Stonetroll's movement. After the pulling a Rock moves 
to the square where the Stonetroll moved from.

A Stonetroll can move to a square occupied with a Rock. In this case 
the Stonetroll throws the Rock in a horizontal or vertical direction. 
The thrown Rock flies over empty squares and Dwarves until it hits an obstacle: 
edge of the board, a Stonetroll, a Sorcerer or another Rock.

If the thrown Rock hits a Sorcerer then it lands on its square, the Sorcerer 
with all other pieces of the same color are removed from the board and 
the game continues without the corresponding player.

Otherwise the Rock lands on the last square before the obstacle (edge of 
the board, a Stonetroll or another Rock). If this square is occupied by 
a Dwarf then the Dwarf is removed from the board.

A Dwarf can push any number of consecutive pieces of any color (including Rocks) 
standing on his path in a straight line if there is an empty square after 
the last piece. All these pieces move one square in the direction of 
the Dwarf's movement.

A Sorcerer can levitate any Rock that wasn't moved (i.e. pushed, pulled, 
thrown or levitated) on the previous player's turn.

A Rock can be levitated  in the same direction as the Sorcerer's movement 
to an empty square only. Once a Sorcerer starts levitating a Rock, he can 
continue levitating the same Rock (but not other Rocks!) on subsequent steps 
during the same turn. The levitation is optional, i.e. a player may decide 
to move his Sorcerer without levitating a Rock. A player is not allowed 
to make a non-continuous levitation, i.e. if after making a levitation step 
the player makes a step without levitation  then he cannot do another 
levitation step during the same turn.
