Zane Fisher's "Nine-Tile Cyvasse"
---------------------------------

This is a fictional, chess-like board game played in A Song of Ice and Fire, 
a series of novels by George R. R. Martin. Nine-Tile Cyvasse is a creative 
interpretation of how the game might be played. The rules and components are 
intended to be completely consistent with the text through A Dance with Dragons, 
the latest in the series at the time of writing.

The game is played in a series of turns, alternating between the two players. 
On a turn, the active player chooses one piece of his color to move. He may 
move that piece by performing either a normal move or a capture, as described 
below. He must move a piece, or forfeit the game. Once he has made his move, 
his opponent's turn begins.

To perform a normal move, the player moves his selected piece from its current 
square to an adjacent square one or more times, up to the movement allowance 
determined by piece's type. A piece may not enter any square more than once 
in a single turn, and it cannot end its movement in the same square it was on 
before moving. A piece cannot enter a mountain square or a square occupied by 
an opposing piece. A piece can be moved through squares occupied by other pieces 
of its own color, but cannot end its movement on a square occupied by another 
piece.

To perform a capture, the player observes the same rules as when performing 
a normal move, except that he must move his piece on a straight path (i.e. only 
in a single direction) and must end its movement on a square occupied by a piece 
of his opponent's color, called the captured piece. In addition, the player must 
check that the captured piece is sufficiently engaged - otherwise, the capture 
cannot be made. Upon completing a capture, the captured piece is removed from 
the game.

Every piece has an armor class and an engagement range, both determined by its type.
A piece is considered to be engaged by an opposing piece if there is a straight path 
between them whose distance is equal to or less than the opposing piece's engagement 
range, and if the path does not pass through a mountain square or a square occupied 
by a piece of the same color as the engaged piece.

A piece's armor class determines how many opposing pieces must be engaging that piece 
for it to be captured: pieces with heavy armor must be engaged by at least two pieces, 
pieces with light armor at least one, and unarmored pieces can be captured without 
being engaged at all. Note that a capture can be made using a piece that is not engaging 
the captured piece.

Squares marked with an 'X' are mountains. Mountain squares cannot be entered by any piece 
except a Dragon, and any two pieces with a mountain between them cannot engage one another.
Squares that are shaded gray are water. If a piece is on a water square, it cannot engage 
other pieces.

If one player captures the other's King, that player wins.

A piece's type determines its armor class, movement allowance, and engagement range. 
There are also special rules pertaining to each type. In any case where these special 
rules contradict the general rules listed above, follow the special rules.

Rabble (x6) - light armor, movement allowance 1, engagement range 1
If a player performs a normal move with a Rabble, she may perform a second normal move 
with a different Rabble on the same turn.

Spears (x3) - light Armor, Movement Allowance 1, Engagement Range 1
A Spears can only engage or capture a piece in the two spaces directly in front of it 
(as if the Spears is facing away from the player it belongs to). Opposing pieces cannot 
move through either the two spaces in front of a Spears in one movement (though they 
can move either into or out of these spaces).

Light Horse (x3) - light Armor, Movement Allowance 3, Engagement Range 1
When capturing, a Light Horse can move beyond the square containing the captured piece, 
continuing in a straight line. Note that the total distance moved must still be less than 
or equal to 3, and that mountains and opposing pieces still block movement.

Heavy Horse (x2) - heavy armor, Movement Allowance 2, Engagement Range 1
When capturing, a Heavy Horse can move beyond the square containing the captured piece, 
continuing in a straight line. Note that the total distance moved must still be less than 
or equal to 2, and that mountains and opposing pieces still block movement.

Elephant (x2) - heavy armor, Movement Allowance 1, Engagement Range 2
An Elephant has a movement allowance of 2 when used to perform a Capture, but cannot move 
through other pieces.

Crossbows (x2) - unarmored, Movement Allowance 2, Engagement Range 3
Crossbows cannot capture.

Trebuchet (x1) - unarmored, Movement Allowance 1, Engagement Range 4 (min. 2)
A Trebuchet cannot engage a piece adjacent to it. To perform a capture with a Trebuchet, 
follow these steps:

1. Choose as the captured piece any opposing piece that is both sufficiently engaged, 
   and engaged by the Trebuchet itself.

2. Move the Trebuchet one square in the direction opposite the captured piece, and remove 
   the captured piece. If the Trebuchet cannot move as described, the capture cannot be 
   performed.

Dragon (x1) - heavy armor, Movement Allowance 4, Engagement Range 2
A Dragon can move through mountain squares and squares containing opposing pieces, 
but cannot end its movement on such squares (unless performing a capture).

Tower (x2) - heavy armor, Movement Allowance 0, Engagement Range 1
Towers cannot be moved. A piece that is adjacent to one or more opposing Towers 
cannot engage any pieces except the adjacent Tower(s).

King (x1) - light armor, Movement Allowance 1, Engagement Range 1
When performing a move from a square adjacent to a Tower of the same color, 
a King can be moved two squares, into the square on the opposite side of the tower, 
as long as the move is an otherwise valid normal move or capture.
