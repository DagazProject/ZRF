Dakon was first mentioned by Sir Thomas Stamford Raffles im his "History of 
Java" in 1817, who wrote that it "is much practiced by women". Today the game 
is mostly played by girls. It is believed that Dakon improves competence in 
calculation and alertness. In Java, the term "dakon stone" refers to the 
similarly pitmarked stones from the bronze-iron age period of Indonesia.

Dakon is played on a board ("papan dakon") with two rows, each one with five 
to nine holes ("sawah"). Seven is considered standard. At either end there is 
also a large store ("lumbung"; ie. "rice bank"). Each hole ("sawah") contains 
seven seeds, if a standard board is used.

On a turn, a player chooses one of the holes under their control. The player 
removes all seeds from this hole, and distributes them in each hole clockwise 
from this hole, in a process called sowing. Sowing skips an opponent's store, 
but does not skip a player's own store.

If the last seed falls into an occupied hole, all the seeds are removed from 
that hole, and are sown starting from that hole. The process continues until 
the last seed falls into a player's store, or an empty hole.

When the last seed falls in an empty hole of the own side, the seeds in the 
opposite hole are captured. This is called "nembak" ("shoot") or "gendong" 
("carrying a load using a length of cloth strapped round the back").

When the last seed is dropped into an opponent's hole, which is empty, the 
opponent's seeds on the right and left sides are taken, if they both contain 
an equal number, and also the seed effecting the capture. This is known as 
"mikul" ("carrying two loads at once using a balanced shoulder pole").
