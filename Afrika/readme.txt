Afrika (German for: "Africa"), a mancala game, was designed on March 2, 2004,
by Ralf Gering in Bad Breisig, Germany.

Play is counterclockwise and single-lap.

If you have no empty holes which are opposite to a non-empty hole of your 
opponent, you distribute the contents of one of your holes, one by one, into 
the following holes If there are enough stones, the starting hole is skipped. 
Then your turn ends without anything being captured.

If you have an empty hole which is opposite to a non-empty hole of your 
opponent, you must capture its contents. If more than one capture is possible, 
you can capture the contents of only one hole per move. You must capture 
the hole which contains the smallest number of stones, but if there are several 
holes with the same minimum number, you decide which contents you take first. 
If you can capture, you must capture. You may not distribute the contents of 
a hole and capture in the same turn.

The game ends when the board is empty. The player gaining the largest number
of stones is accounted the winner.
