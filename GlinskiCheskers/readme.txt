Glinski's Cheskers
------------------

This is an experimental game that combines Glinski's chess and Russian checkers in a similar way to Belarusian chess.
See the page http://www.chessvariants.com/hexagonal.dir/hexagonal.html for more. This version of hexagonal chess was 
invented in 1936 by Wladyslaw Glinski. 

Checkers capture in all directions, but move only forward. At the last rank, the checker turns into a long-range dama.
Capturing by checkers takes precedence over even defending the King from a check. Checkmate the king to win.
