Shafran's Checkers
------------------
2 variants

These checkers were proposed by Dmitry Skyruk as a possible reconstruction of the lost hexagonal checkers 
invented by Isaac Shafran. Isaac Grigoryevich Shafran believed that a completely symmetrical board either 
does not give operational space or is too large, therefore he suggested playing chess on a special, 
“elongated” board, and checkers on a “shortened” hexagonal board. These ideas were ambiguously received 
by the community and the rules of the board were lost.

The object of the game is to prevent the opponent from making a legal move. The rules of the game are similar to 
International checkers, except that when choosing from two or more branches of capture, the player can choose any one.
Promotion takes place in the last row of the board.
