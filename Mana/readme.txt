Claude Leroy's Mana
-------------------
2 variants

The Mana is an abstract strategy game has been invented by Claude Leroy in 2005.
This game inspiration using a Polynesian concept (the mana).

Each player controls one Damyo and five Ronin and tries to capture the opponent’s 
Damyo with his own Damyo or one of his Ronin.

Each player in turn moves one of his pieces.

- A piece starting movement on a single square must move one square, a piece 
  on a double square must move two squares and a piece on a triple square must 
  move three squares.
- A piece can move horizontally or vertically but not diagonally.
- A piece can change direction during movement.
- A piece can not pass over an occupied square.
- A piece can not cross the same square twice during its movement.
- A piece ending its movement on a square with an opponent’s piece captures 
  that piece (the piece is removed from the gameboard). 
  NOTE: If the captured piece is the opponent’s Damyo the game ends!

Mana is used to restrict the opponent’s movement. When the first player finishes 
his first move he places the Mana on his just moved piece. The other player must 
then move a piece (Ronin or Damyo) located on the same type of square as the first 
player’s Mana carrying piece. When he finishes his move, he places in turn the Mana 
on his just moved piece restricting other player’s next move, and so on. (So each 
piece that has just moved becomes a Mana carrier).

There are two exceptions:

- No pieces are located on the same type of square as the Mana carrying piece, or...
- Pieces are located on the same type of square as the Mana carrying piece but they 
  can not move their full movement (because they are blocked by other pieces).

In both of these cases the player has two choices:

Move another piece (in that case that piece will move according to the type of square 
that it occupies)

or

Take one of his captured Ronin and place it on any empty square. (Returning a captured 
Ronin to the gameboard ends the player’s turn).
