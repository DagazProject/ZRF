Mancala is a family of board games played around the world, sometimes 
called "sowing" games, or "count-and-capture" games, which describes 
the gameplay.

Most mancala games share a common general game play. Players begin by placing 
a certain number of seeds, prescribed for the particular game, in each of 
the pits on the game board. A player may count their stones to plot the game. 
A turn consists of removing all seeds from a pit, "sowing" the seeds 
(placing one in each of the following pits in sequence) and capturing based 
on the state of board. This leads to the English phrase "count and capture" 
sometimes used to describe the gameplay. Although the details differ greatly, 
this general sequence applies to all games.
