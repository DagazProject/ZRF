Knight Court
------------
The object is to checkmate the opponent's Knight. All the pieces move as 
in normal chess. Rules regarding check and checkmate that would normally 
apply to the king here apply to the knight.

Also, when a piece is captured, the owner of that piece may 'drop' that 
piece onto an empty square on any subsequent turn (this is like Shogi, 
except the pieces do not change owners.

Important: it is illegal to move back and forth between the same positions 
(in other words, no draw by three-move repetition). Both players must vary 
their moves.
