Puluc
-----

Puluc, also called Boolik and Bul, is a game played by the Kekchi people of 
North Guatemala in Central America. The Kekchi people are descendants of the 
Mayans, which induces some authors to speculate that Puluc is a Mayan game.

Each player starts the game with five pieces of his colour, all starting 
in his home city at his end of the track.  There are four casting sticks that 
control the movement of the players, the sticks each having one side marked.
The value of a throw is the number of marked sides showing, or five if all 
four sticks are showing their blank side.

A player's turn consists of throwing the casting sticks then moving one of 
his pieces. If the player has pieces in his home city he may move one onto 
the track, by the number of spaces shown by the casting sticks.  Alternatively 
if the player has other non-captured pieces on the track, he may opt to move 
one of these by the appropriate number of spaces instead.

A player may not land one of his pieces on top of another, unless the latter 
is a captive of the enemy.  When a moving piece reaches or passes the enemy 
city, he is returned to his home city, and his captives are removed from play.

If a piece lands on an enemy on the track, the enemy is captured.  If the 
captured enemy himself had captives, those captives are freed as soon their 
deliverer moves away carrying their former captor with him.  When moving a piece 
from on top of a pile, the top piece carries his immediate captives with him, 
freeing his formerly captured compatriots to move with any of their captives 
on a future turn.  His immediate captives and any further immediate captured 
enemies move with him till he reaches the enemy city.

A player wins the game when all his opponent's pieces have been either killed 
or captured.
