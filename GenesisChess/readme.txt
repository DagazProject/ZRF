Genesis Chess
-------------

5 variants
Based on Zillions of Games Chess version.

Object:

Genesis Chess is a fast-paced highly strategic chess variant. 
The game is played on a normal 8x8 chess board with the standard 
set of pieces. However, instead of the initial piece configuration, 
the game begins with a blank board. On each player's first turn 
they must place their king down anywhere on the board that 
does not place the other king in check. 

The game then continues with each player either placing down a new piece 
or moving an already placed piece. Like regular chess, the goal is 
to checkmate the opponent's king, and henceforth the game ends under 
the same circumstances.

Piece Placement:

Pieces that have not been placed on the board are called reserve pieces; 
pieces that have already been placed are called active pieces. 
The rules of placing a piece down are the following: 

  1. A piece may not be placed down on an already occupied space.
  2. If a piece placement results in checking the opponent's king 
     then the move is illegal.
  3. A piece can be placed to block check.

Piece Movement:

All pieces move the same as in regular chess except for pawns. 
Because the game starts out with a blank board there is no meaning 
in board orientation. Therefore, the pawns have been altered to move 
omni-directional. They can move horizontally and vertically back 
and forth one space, but can only capture diagonally one space in 
any direction. The pawn's special moves, for example, 
promotion and en passant, have been removed from the game, 
along with castling, because those moves only make sense with a fixed 
starting configuration and orientation. Also like regular chess, 
making a move that would put ones own king in check or making a move 
that does not get oneself out of check are illegal.
