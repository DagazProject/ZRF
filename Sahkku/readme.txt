Sahkku
------
2 variants

Sahkku is a running-fight game, which means that players move their pieces
along a track with the goal of eliminating the other player's pieces. 
Many different versions of sahkku have been played in different parts of Sapmi.

When the game begins, the soldiers are inactive — that is, unable to move.
A player can activate a soldier by throwing a sahkku. Pieces are moved
in accordance with values shown on the dice after a throw. Several pieces
are allowed to occupy the same point.

Soldier's path is as follows: towards the player's right when they are
in their home row (the row where they begin), towards the left when they
are in the middle row, towards the right when they are in the enemy row,
towards the left again the second time they move across the middle row,
and repeat.

The King begins neutral, not controlled by either player and will be recruited
by he first player to move one of their pieces onto the point currently occupied
by the King. The king can move orthogonally right, left, up, and down. This means
that when reaching an end of the middle row, it can choose to go up into the enemy
row, or down into the home row, and also that it can move between the horizontal
lines. It can not change direction while utilizing the value of one die.

The player not currently playing with the king may recruit it by moving a soldier
onto the point currently occupied by the king. The king then becomes part of that
player's army, until it is recruited by the opposing player again.

The object of the game is to capture all of the opponent's soldiers, that is,
to remove them from the board. An opponent's soldier is captured when a player
moves a soldier, or the recruited king, onto a point occupied by the opponent.
If the point in question is occupied by several opposing soldiers, all those
soldiers are captured.
