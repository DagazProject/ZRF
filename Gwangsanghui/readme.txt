2 variants

Pieces designed by Ilya V. Novikov.
Rules variant by V. Chelnokov.

Gwangsanghui is an 18th century Janggi variant. It was recorded in "Noeyeonjip" 
which was written by Nam Yuyong.

Rules for moving the King and Generals is the same as General in traditional 
Janggi. The same Janggi rules apply to Pawn (Spearman), Chariot, Horse, Elephant, Cannon and Guard.
You cannot start game with Cannon's move.
Rule about Kings opposition also applies (in Janggi Kings opposition means draw).
If player don't have any valid moves, he can pass his move once.

- Swordsman (diagonal Pawn) can only move forward 1 step diagonally.
- Knight(Diplomate) moves like Horse, but cannot take other pieces or taken by other 
  pieces on the board. It can only be taken by Assasin.
- Assasin can move 1 step diagonally in any direction.
- Warrior can move horizontally or vertically one or two steps.
- Forward and Backward Shields cannot move or capture. Shields can only be captured by exchange.

You win if you capture the King. If General from either West or East Castle is captures, all the pieces of corresponding castle belong to 
the other party (the ownership changes). Each Castle (West and East) have 1 General, 1 Cannon, 1 Horse, 1 Chariot, 1 Guard, 1 Elephant. 
However, if you capture the piece which captured your General right afterwards, you can get all pieces of this castle (which are present on board) back.
