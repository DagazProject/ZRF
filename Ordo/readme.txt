Ordo
----

Ordo is a two-player board game invented by Dieter Stein in 2009.

The goal of Classic Ordo is to reach the opposite row with one of the player's checkers.  
A player can also win the game by capturing all opponent's checkers or by breaking the 
group of opponent's checkers in such a way that the opponent is unable to reconnect his 
group on his next move.

During the game, after a player's move, all of that player's checkers must be connected 
(orthogonally or diagonally) in one sole group.  If a group of a player's checkers is 
disconnected as a result of a capture made by the opponent, the player must move to reconnect 
his group again.  If no such move is possible, the player loses the game.
