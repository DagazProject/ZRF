Pasang is a two-player abstract strategy board game from Brunei.

The game contains several phases:

FIRST PHASE - The first player captures a column of 5 stones from his half of the board.
- If the first player chooses the central column, the second player may choose to remove 
  any of his columns except the central one.
- If the first player chooses another column, the second player must choose a column from 
  the diagonally opposite sector.

SECOND PHASE
- Each player selects a stone horizontally adjacent to his empty cells and move it to the 
  adjacent empty cell. This stone is the Ka.
- When the Ka moves to the empty cell it must execute a capture (like in the third phase below).

THIRD PHASE 
- The Ka slides orthogonally thru one or more empty cells into a cell where it will form a line 
  with an odd number of stones of the same color, capturing them.
- This line may be separated with empty cells, but not with stones of a different color 
  (which includes the enemy Ka).
- If more than one of line is formed, the player may choose one (and just one).
- If the Ka slides vertically, the captured line must be horizontal. if the Ka slides horizontally, 
  the captured line must be vertical.

GOAL - A player wins by:
- stalemating the opponent or
- having the highest score when all stones are captured (1 point for each black stone and 2 points 
  for white stones).
