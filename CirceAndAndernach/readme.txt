Andernach chess is a chess variant in which a piece making a capture 
(except kings) changes colour. Non-capturing moves are played as in orthodox 
chess. If a pawn captures on eighth rank, it is promoted first and then 
changes colour.

The game was named after the German town of Andernach, which is the site of 
annual meetings of fairy chess enthusiasts. It was during the 1993 meeting 
there that Andernach chess was introduced with a chess problem composing 
tournament for Andernach problems.
