Gufuu Shogi
-----------

Invented by Georg Dunkel in 1998.

The idea of the game is the same as in chess of shogi: to capture opponent's King.

Four modes to do the move:

1. Dropping: A piece in hand can be dropped to the board to any free square. 
   When drop the piece there is four directions choose to set the piece on 
   the square, North(N), East(E), South(S) and West(W).
2. Ordinary move: After the move to empty square, the face of piece has to 
   rotate 90 degrees to clockwise.
3. Capture move: After the capture, the face of piece has to rotate 90 degrees 
   to clockwise.
4. Rotation only: The piece can be rotated in current without moving other square. 
   The face of piece has to rotate 90 degrees to clockwise.

Coming from the small board Kings are allowed to stay side by side. The only limitation 
is that Kings can't be next to each other face-to-face position.

As in original shogi, the captured piece transfers to the Hand and it can be returned 
later back to the board. Player can select to do his move on the board or to return 
piece from hand to any empty square on the board.

Note: It's illegal to check by dropping a piece.

When it's Black's turn the Kaze and Arashi are Black's pieces, and when move will 
change to White, the same pieces are White's pieces. Same rule relates also to pieces 
in hand. Because Arashi and Kaze are shared pieces, they can also captured each others 
regardless of own or opponents pieces. Also King is allowred to capture "own" Arashi 
or Kaze if they don't check. Only when Kaze or Arashi are checking, they get fixed owner 
and then the King is not allowed to capture the checking piece. Still the other 
shared piece can capture the checking piece.

Necessity for check is a little bit different compared original shogi or chess: 
It's not enough if piece reach to threaten opponent's King, besides that the checking piece 
has to have contact to own King.
