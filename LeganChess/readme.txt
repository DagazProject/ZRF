Legan chess
-----------
Invented by L. Legan in 1913.

Legan chess differs from standard chess by the starting position as well as by pawn movements.
Pawns move one square diagonally forward: White from right to left and Black left to right. 
They capture orthogonally in direction of movements. Pawns promote on squares occupied 
in the initial position by the opponent's king, bishops, knights, and rooks.
There is no castling and no en passant.
