Toguz Kumalak
-------------

Toguz Kumalak is a two-player game in the mancala family that is played in 
Central Asia. The game is played on a board with two rows of nine holes
and two big pits called Kazans.

A player wins a game if he accumulates more seeds in his own kazan than 
the opponent. If both players have accumulated the same number of seeds, 
the game ends by a draw.

Players take turns sowing their seeds. The sowing is performed in the 
following way:


- The player picks all seeds up from one of the pits on his side.
- If the chosen pit contained more than one seed then the first picked up 
  seed is dropped back to the starting pit. Then the player continues dropping 
  the taken seeds in counter-clockwise direction, one seed in a pit.
- If the chosen pit contained only one seed then the player drops it in the 
  next pit in counter-clockwise direction.

If the last sown seed  lands in a pit on the opponent's side and brings the 
total number of seeds in the pit to the even number then all seeds from the 
pit are captured by the player and are moved to the player's kazan.

If the last sown seed  lands in a pit on the opponent's side and brings the 
total number of seeds in the pit to three then all seeds from the pit are 
captured by the player and are moved to the player's kazan and the pit turns 
into the player's tuzdik ("sacred place" in Kazakh; or tuz in Kyrgyz, which 
means "salt"). There are several cases when tuzdik is not created:

- A player can have no more than one tuzdik.
- The last pit of the opponent (his ninth or rightmost pit) cannot be turned 
  into a tuzdik.
- A tuzdik cannot be created if it is symmetrical to the opponent's one.
