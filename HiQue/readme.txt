HiQue (r)
---------
2 variants

HiQue was designed by Gregg Steven Blasingame and published in 1998 by 
the D&L Company. The object is to get a runner from your back row to 
the opponent's back row.

Runners may move one space forward or to either side, but not backwards.
Guards may move any number of unobstructed spaces in any of the 4 directions.
Runners may be captured if 2 enemy guards occupy adjacent spaces. Multiple 
runners may be captured in one move of a guard in this manner. Guards may 
never be captured. Play ends when one runner makes it to the enemy back line, 
or all of one side's runners are eliminated.
