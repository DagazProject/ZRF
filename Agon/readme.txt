Agon
----

Agon may be the oldest abstract strategy game played on a 6 by 6 by 6 
hexagonally tiled board, first appearing as early as the late Eighteenth 
Century in France. The game reached it greatest popularity a hundred years 
later when the Victorians embraced it for its combination of simple moves 
and complex strategy.

The Objective: To place your queen in the center hexagon and surround her 
with all six of her guards.

Moves: Think of the Agon board as a series of concentric circles. 
Pieces can move one space at a time either in the same ring or the ring 
closer to the center.

Capturing: A piece is captured when there are two enemy pieces on either 
side of it. The player with the captured piece must use his or her next move 
to place the captured piece on the outside hexagon. If the captured piece is 
a guard, the player whose piece was captured can choose where on the outer hex 
to place the piece. If the piece is a queen, the player who made the capture 
decides where the queen should go. If more than one piece is captured in one 
turn, the player whose pieces were captured must move them one turn at a time.

If a player surrounds the center hexagon with guards without getting the queen 
into position, that player forfeits the game.
