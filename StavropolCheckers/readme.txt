Stavropol Checkers
------------------

Object: Capture all your opponent's pieces (`Checkers` or `Kings`) by jumping over them.
You can move friendly and enemy pices.

All pieces move on diagonals, either by sliding to an adjacent empty square or by jumping over
an enemy piece to a vacant square on the other side.
Jumping over a piece captures it.  Capturing is mandatory and you must keep jumping and
capturing as long as it is possible.  Checkers move only a single square forward until the back row,
where they promote to Kings. Kings may move to any squares forwards or backwards.
