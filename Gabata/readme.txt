Selus
-----
Selus is a generic name given to mancala games which are played on three-row
boards. Apparently, the word derived from Geez selus which means "three".

Each move starts with a player emptying the contents of one of his holes that
is not a wegue ("wound"). Then, the seeds are dropped one by one into the 
following holes.

If the last seed falls into an occupied hole other than a wegue, the player 
takes up its contents and distributes these seeds in a new lap. The move ends 
if the last seed is dropped into an empty hole. This is called kwah, 
an onomatopoetic word that imitates the sound of the stone alighting
on the board.

It is not permitted to pass a move unless a player has no legal move left.

Wegues are created when the last seed distributed falls into a hole of three, 
thus making four seeds. The creator is called the owner of the wound who marks 
it in a distinctive way. Creating a wegue ends the move. A wegue can be created 
on either side of the board.

If the last seed of a move is dropped into a wegue, the player captures 
this seed and, unless the wound was empty, one of the seeds it contained. 
Capturing is permitted from any wegue, irrespective of the owner. 
The player must move again (beginning with any hole of his side which is not 
a wegue) if he captured from a wegue he owns, but must stop moving, 
if he captured from a wegue owned by his opponent.

Exception:

The two left-hand holes in a player's back row are called ayemi ("eye"). 
A player is not permitted to capture from an eye on his side, only from 
the opponent's side. In that case, he must move again, even if he has captured 
from an opponent's wegue. If the last seed fell into a wegue in your own ayemi,
the move ends.

The creation of a wound is only permitted after the original set-up has been 
destroyed, i.e. after the first move of a game. If, in the first move, the last 
seed makes four seeds, they are distributed in another lap.

The game ends when both players have no move left. Each player scores a point 
for each captured seed and a point for each seed in a wegue owned by him. 
The player with most points wins.

Gabata
------
One of the diverse mancala family of games is Gabata, played on three rows 
of six holes. Its antiquity is not known, but it was first recorded in western 
literature by J. T. Bent in 1893, in his book Sacred City of the Ethiopians. 

At the start of the game, each player simultaneously picks up the pieces in 
his first hole, and sows the pieces by dropping one in each subsequent hole 
along the route described above.

This is a race, and it continues until one of the players drops their last 
piece into an empty hole. The game proper then begins as below. From this point
on, the players take turns, starting with the player who dropped his last piece 
in the empty hole.

To move, a player selects any one of his own holes, and sows it. If the last 
piece drops into an already-occupied hole, all the pieces are picked up from 
that hole and the player continues to sow. This continues until the last piece 
is dropped into an empty hole. At that point, the player captures any enemy 
pieces in the same column of holes into which he dropped that last piece. 
If nothing is captured, the turn ends.

At some point, one player's side will be empty of pieces. The opponent 
then captures all pieces on his side of the board.
