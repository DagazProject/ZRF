Tchuka Ruma, a mancala game, was first described as Tchouka by the French 
mathematician Henri-Auguste Delannoy (1833-1915) in 1895. 
He said that his article is from his correspondence with Edouard 
Lucas (1842-1891).

The goal is to collect as many stones as possible in the "ruma".

- On his turn a player takes all the stones of a non-empty hole and sows them, 
  one by one, towards the "ruma" into the following holes.
- If the last stone falls in a non-empty hole other than the "ruma", 
  its contents are distributed in another lap. 
- If the last stone falls in the "ruma", the player moves again.
- If the last stone is put into an empty hole, the game is over.
