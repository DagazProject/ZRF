Luzhanqi
--------
4 variants

Luzhanqi is a two-player Chinese board game. It is a non-perfect abstract 
strategy game of partial information, since each player has only limited 
knowledge concerning the disposition of the opposing pieces.

The aim of the game is to capture the opponent's flag through penetrating his 
defenses, while trying to prevent him from capturing the player's own flag. 
The Luzhanqi board has a number of features which affect how pieces move.

- Post - also Soldier Station: a normal space, marked as a rectangle on the 
  board. Pieces can move on or off these spaces at will, and can be attacked 
  and captured on them.
- Roads - usually marked as thin lines on the board. A piece can only travel 
  one space across a road at any time.
- Railroads - usually marked as thick lines on the board, a piece can travel 
  any number of spaces along a railroad in a straight line, as long as its 
  path is not obstructed by another piece.
- Campsite - marked as a circle on the board, with 5 in each player's territory.
  A piece on a campsite cannot be attacked.
- Mountains - pieces cannot move over these two spaces.
- Frontlines - these three spaces are the only points at which a piece can 
  enter the opponent's territory. Pieces do not land on these spaces, they pass 
  over them.
- Headquarters - positioned at two sides of the central axis at the sixth rank 
  of the player's territory, the Flag must be placed on one of these two spaces. 
  It, together with the other piece placed on the other headquarters, must not 
  move after the game starts.

Each player has 25 pieces, which are identical except for markings on one side. 
They are listed here in order of order, where any piece of a higher order may 
capture one of lower order (if the enemy is of the same order, both pieces will
be removed from the board). 

Each player has:

- one Field Marshal, order 9
- one General or Army Commander, order 8
- two Major Generals or Division Commanders, order 7
- two Brigadier Generals or Brigade Commanders, order 6
- two Colonels or Regiment Commanders, order 5
- two Majors or Battalion Commanders, order 4
- three Captains or Company Commanders, order 3
- three Lieutenants or Platoon Commanders, order 2
- three Engineers or Sappers, order 1
- two Bombs
- three Landmines
- one Flag

Some of these pieces have special features and abilities:

- The Engineers are the only pieces which can turn corners when travelling 
  along the Railroad. Engineers can also capture Landmines without being 
  removed from the board.
- Bombs, when in contact with any opponent piece, destroy both itself and 
  the piece. They may capture the opponent's flag. Bombs cannot be placed 
  on the front line (the first rank) during the initial set-up.
- Landmines are immune to any attack, and cause the destruction of attacking 
  pieces (except when attacked by an Engineer or destroyed by a bomb). 
  Depending on the ruleset used, Landmines may or may not be removed from play 
  following a capture. Landmines may only be placed on the fifth and sixth 
  ranks during set-up. The Landmine cannot move from its original position.
- The Flag must be placed on one of the two Headquarters spaces on the sixth 
  rank. It cannot move. Its capture brings the victory of the attacker and 
  ends the game. Also, when Field Marshal is destroyed, the Flag must be 
  revealed to the opposing player.
